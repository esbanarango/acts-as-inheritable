_Acts As Inheritable_ is a Ruby Gem specifically written for Rails/ActiveRecord models. It is meant to be used with the [_Self-Referential Association_](#self-referential-association), or with a model having a `parent` that shares the inheritable attributes. This will let you inherit any __attribute__ or __relation__ from the _parent_ model.

### Self-Referential Association

This is a code example on how to implement _Self-Referential Association_

````ruby
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :parent, class: Person
  has_many :children, class: Person, foreign_key: :parent_id
  has_many :grandchildren, class: Person, through: :children, source: :children
end
````

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'acts_as_inheritable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install acts_as_inheritable

## Usage
You can enable _ActsAsInheritable_ by adding `acts_as_inheritable` into your model. You need to define at least one option, either `attributes` or `associations`. Those options are _arrays_ containing the atrributes names or the associations names.

```ruby

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base

  acts_as_inheritable attributes: %w(favorite_color last_name soccer_team),
                      associations: %w(shoes pictures clan)

  # Associations
  belongs_to  :parent, class_name: 'Person'
  belongs_to  :clan
  has_many    :children, class_name: 'Person', foreign_key: :parent_id
  has_many    :toys
  has_many    :shoes
  has_one     :pet
  has_many    :pictures, as: :imageable

  # Callbacks
  before_validation :inherit_attributes, on: :create
  before_validation :inherit_relations, on: :create
end

parent = Person.create(last_name: 'Arango', soccer_team: 'Verdolaga', favorite_color:'Green')

son = Person.create(parent: parent)
son.last_name # => Arango
son.soccer_team # => Verdolaga
son.favorite_color # => Green

````
### Available methods
By adding `acts_as_inheritable` to your models you will have access to these methods:

#### inherit_attributes
> Signature `inherit_attributes(force = false, not_force_for = [], method_to_update = nil)`

By default this method  will only set values that are [blank?](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Object.html#method-i-blank-3F).

###### params
  - `force`: Default to true. Set the attribute even if it's _present_.
  - `not_force_for`: Default to empty array. When setting `force` to _true_, you can also specify the attributes you don't want to overwrite.
  - `method_to_update`: Default to nil. Uses the specified method (`update_attributes` or `update_columns`) instead of the normal asignation (`"#{attribute}="`). This is useful if you're using __inherit_attributes__  inside an `after_save` callback or if you want to skip validations for example.

#### inherit_relations
> Signature `inherit_relations(model_parent = send(:parent), current = self)`

```ruby

class Person < ActiveRecord::Base

  acts_as_inheritable associations: %w(pet)

  # Associations
  has_one     :pet

  # Callbacks
  before_validation :inherit_relations, on: :create
end

parent = Person.create(last_name: 'Arango')
parent_pet = Pet.create(person: parent, name: 'Mango', breed:'Golden Retriver')
parent_pet.inspect #=> #<Pet id: 1, person_id: 1, name: "Mango", breed: "Golden Retriver">

son = Person.create(parent: parent)
son.pet.inspect # => #<Pet id: 2, person_id: 2, name: "Mango", breed: "Golden Retriver">

````

### Handling your own `dup`

By default new relations are _duplicated_ using [dup](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Object.html#method-i-dup), which produces a shallow copy of the object. But you can also handle this as you want by defining a `duplicate!` method.


## Testing

All tests follow the RSpec format and are located in the spec directory. They can be run with:

````bash
$ rspec
````
